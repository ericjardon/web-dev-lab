# Authentication vs Authorization

- Authentication determinbes who you are (provide credentials)
- Authorization comes logically after, and determines what permissions an authenticated person has.

Authentication can be single-factor, 2-factor or multi-factor.
Authentication could test Something You Know (password), Something You Have (2FA) or Something You Are (biometrics).

Security in a system is a combination of both mechanisms. 


The work resides in our /bikes-api project.
